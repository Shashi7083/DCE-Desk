<input type="button" onclick="return toggleMe('6')" value="CONSTITUTION OF INDIA – BASIC FEATURES AND FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES" class="button"><br>
<span id="6" style='display:none'><p > <br><b>CONSTITUTION OF INDIA – BASIC
    FEATURES AND FUNDAMENTAL
    PRINCIPLES</b><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    The Constitution of India is the supreme law of India. Parliament of India can not make
    any law which violates the Fundamental Rights enumerated under the Part III of the
    Constitution. The Parliament of India has been empowered to amend the Constitution under
    Article 368, however, it cannot use this power to change the “basic structure” of the
    constitution, which has been ruled and explained by the Supreme Court of India in
    its historical judgments.<br/>
    The Constitution of India reflects the idea of “Constitutionalism” – a modern and
    progressive concept historically developed by the thinkers of “liberalism” – an ideology
    which has been recognized as one of the most popular political ideology and result of
    historical struggles against arbitrary use of sovereign power by state. The historic
    revolutions in France, England, America and particularly European Renaissance and
    Reformation movement have resulted into progressive legal reforms in the form of
    “constitutionalism” in many countries. The Constitution of India was made by borrowing
    models and principles from many countries including United Kingdom and America.
    The Constitution of India is not only a legal document but it also reflects social, political
    and economic perspectives of the Indian Society. It reflects India’s legacy of “diversity”. It
    has been said that Indian constitution reflects ideals of its freedom movement, however, few
    critics have argued that it does not truly incorporate our own ancient legal heritage and
    cultural values. No law can be “static” and therefore the Constitution of India has also been
    amended more than one hundred times. These amendments reflect political, social and
    economic developments since the year 1950.<br/>
    The Indian judiciary and particularly the Supreme Court of India has played an historic role
    as the guardian of people. It has been protecting not only basic ideals of the Constitution but
    also strengthenedthe same through progressive interpretations of the text of the Constitution.
    The judicial activism of the Supreme Court of India and its historic contributions has been
    recognized throughout the world and it gradually made it “as one of the strongest court in
    the world”.<br/>
