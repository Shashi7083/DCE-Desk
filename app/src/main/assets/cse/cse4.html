A CONSTITUENT SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATED AND CO-EXIST WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AROUND US. WE ARE NOT AN ENTITY
SO SEPARATE FROM THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE CAN THINK OF MASTERING AND CONTROLLING IT RATHER WE
MUST UNDERSTAND THAT EACH AND EVERY ACTION OF OURS REFLECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND VICE VERSA. ANCIENT
WISDOM DRAWN FROM VEDAS ABOUT ENVIRONMENT AND ITS SUSTENANCE REFLECTS THESE ETHOS. THERE IS A DIRECT
APPLICATION OF THIS WISDOM EVEN IN MODERN TIMES. IDEA OF AN ACTIVITY BASED COURSE ON ENVIRONMENT
PROTECTION IS TO SENSITIZE THE STUDENTS
ON THE ABOVE ISSUES THROUGH FOLLOWING TWO TYPE OF ACTIVITIES:
<br/><br/>
(a) AWARENESS ACTIVITIES:<br/>
i) SMALL GROUP MEETINGS ABOUT WATER MANAGEMENT, PROMOTION OF RECYCLE USE, GENERATION OF LESS
WASTE, AVOIDING ELECTRICITY WASTE<br/>
ii) SLOGAN MAKING EVENTS<br/>
iii) POSTER MAKING EVENTS<br/>

(b) ACTUAL ACTIVITIES:<br/>
i) PLANTATION<br/>
ii) GIFTING A TREE TO SEE ITS FULL GROWTH<br/>
iii) CLEANLINESS DRIVE<br/>
iv) DRIVE FOR SEGREGATION OF WASTE<br/>
v) TO LIVE SOME BIG ENVIRONMENTALIST FOR A WEEK OR SO TO UNDERSTAND HIS WORK<br/>
