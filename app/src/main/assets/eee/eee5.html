    CONSTITUTION OF INDIA/ESSENCE OF INDIAN
KNOWLEDGE TRADITIONAL
 </b><br>
 The Constitution of India is the supreme law of India. Parliament of India cannot make
any law which violates the Fundamental Rights enumerated under the Part III of
the Constitution. The Parliament of India has been empowered to amend the
Constitution under Article 368, however, it cannot use this power to change the
“basic structure” of the constitution, which has been ruled and explained by the
Supreme Court of India in its historical judgments. The Constitution of India reflects
the idea of “Constitutionalism” – a modern and progressive concept historically
developed by the thinkers of “liberalism” – an ideology which has been recognized as
one of the most popular political ideology and result of historical struggles against
arbitrary use of sovereign power by state. The historic revolutions in France, England,
America and particularly European Renaissance and Reformation movement have
resulted into progressive legal reforms in the form of “constitutionalism” in many
countries. The Constitution of India was made by borrowing models and principles from
many countries including United Kingdom and America.<br/>
The Constitution of India is not only a legal document but it also reflects social,
political and economic perspectives of the Indian Society. It reflects India’s legacy of
“diversity”. It has been said that Indian constitution reflects ideals of its freedom
movement, however, few critics have argued that it does not truly incorporate our
own ancient legal heritage and cultural values. No law can be “static” and therefore
the Constitution of India has also been amended more than one hundred times. These
amendments reflect political, social and economic developments since the year
1950. The Indian judiciary and particularly the Supreme Court of India has played an
historic role as the guardian of people. It has been protecting not only basic ideals of the
Constitution but also strengthened the same through progressive interpretations of the
text of the Constitution. The judicial activism of the Supreme Court of India and its
historic contributions has been recognized throughout the world and it gradually made
it “as one of the strongest court in the world”.<br/>
