    <BR/>
    The objective of this Course is to introduce to continuum mechanics and material modeling
    of engineering materials based on first energy principles: deformation and strain; momentum
    balance, stress and stress states; elasticity and elasticity bounds; plasticity and yield design.
    The overarching theme is a unified mechanistic language using thermodynamics, which
    allows understanding, modelling and design of a large range of engineering materials. The
    subject of mechanics of materials involves analytical methods for determining the strength,
    stiffness (deformation characteristics), and stability of the various members in a structural
    system. The behavior of a member depends not only on the fundamental laws that govern the
    equilibrium of forces, but also on the mechanical characteristics of the material. These
    mechanical characteristics come from the laboratory, where materials are tested under
    accurately known forces and their behavior is carefully observed and measured (learnt in the
    previous course on Materials, Testing & Evaluation). For this reason, mechanics of materials
    is a blended science of experiment and Newtonian postulates of analytical mechanics.

    ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
 </B><BR><BR/>

    We as human being are not an entity separate from the environment around us
rather we are a constituent seamlessly integrated and co-exist with the environment around
us. We are not an entity so separate from the environment that we can think of
mastering and controlling it rather we must understand that each and every action of ours
reflects on the environment and vice versa. Ancient wisdom drawn from Vedas about
environment and its sustenance reflects these ethos. There is a direct application of this
wisdom even in modern times. Idea of an activity based course on environment protection is to
sensitize the students on the above issues through following two type of activities:<br/><br/>
 <SPAN> (a) Awareness Activities:</SPAN><BR/>
 
 i) Small group meetings about water management, promotion of recycle use, generation
of less waste, avoiding electricity waste<BR/>
ii) Slogan making events<BR/>
iii) Poster making events<BR/>
iv) Cycle rally<BR/>
v) Lectures from experts<BR/><BR/>

<SPAN> (a) Awareness Activities:</SPAN><BR/>
 
i)
Plantation<BR/>
ii)
Gifting a tree to see its full growthv
iii)
Cleanliness drive<BR/>
iv)
Drive for segregation of waste<BR/>
v)
To live some big environmentalist for a week or so to understand his workv
vi)
To work in kitchen garden for mess<BR/>
vii) To know about the different varieties of plants<BR/>
viii) Shutting down the fans and ACs of the campus for an hour or so<BR/>
